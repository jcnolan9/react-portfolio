            <img src='BlackGuy_Locks.jpg'></img>
            <p>"Growth mindset" is the best term to describe me. I am continuosly learning and striving to better myself 
                whether that be by gaining new skills, traveling to new places, interacting with new cultures and peoples, or 
                through self-examination and reflection. I am innately curious and have a strong impulse to understand the world around 
                me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Web development is the perfect arena to satisfy this curious as the world around us becomes more interconnected,
                digitized, and powered by technology, specifically web technologies which have and will continue to enable new 
                products, services, business models, ways to connect with other, financial paradigms and more. I'm excited to be on
                this web development journey and look forward to contributing a piece of the better and interconnected future 
                developers around the world  are  working to build. Check out some of my sample work and projects here on this page.
